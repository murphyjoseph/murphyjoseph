# Hello

Hello! I'm Joseph, but you can call me Murph. Welcome to my digital playground here on GitHub. Probably the only thing of value on display at the moment are my contributions which include all the work I've done while at Zumper. Currently, I'm sprucing up this space, so expect more polished repos soon. In the meantime, enjoy the glimpses of my tech shenanigans and stay tuned for some upgraded showcases! ðŸ˜Š

TODO
- Utilizie the Wrapper component more to better streamline spacing between components
- Convert the SectionPerson into the SectionAboutUs so that there are proper titles and descriptions going on
- Add things into storybook
- Create unit tests
- Better organize the images. Probably should be public/images/**
- Maybe we don't need that spacer component at all
- Add links to the cards for our events to the specific pages
- Add in LinkedIn or socials for the about us for Allan and I
